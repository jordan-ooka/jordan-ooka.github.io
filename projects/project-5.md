## HACC
In the 2018 I participated in the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. This hackathon was a multiple week long event in which different groups come together to create apps to fufill the needs of specific challenges that are presented. 

## What is OWO?
OWO is an app that my group and I created to solve the challenge issued by the University of Hawaii Office of Sustainability. Their challenge was to create an app to aid them in auditing trash at special trash audit events. Originally the volunteers at these events had to calculate the number of trash per trash bag by hand. Our app converted that system from a handwritten one to a digitalized one.

## My contribution 
My main contribution to the app was to create the database and the functions to allow users to submit the audit data to the database.

## What I Learned
This was my first experience with Google Firebase. I learned a more on how to work with databases for webapps, but I think I need more experience to use it comfortably.
