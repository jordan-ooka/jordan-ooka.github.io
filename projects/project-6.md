## ICS 414 Project
My partner and I were tasked to create an app using an ambient device given to us. We were given a Yeelight with only white lighting. We created an app called Hoala which we developed on Android Studio using the Yeelight API.

## What is Hoala?
Hoala is an app which allowed the user to control the intensity and hue of the lightbulb, changed hue based on temperature, and change brightness based on an alarm system.

## My contribution 
My contribution to the project was to scrape data from a weather site and to allow the light bulb change brightness and hue based on temperature and weather forecast.

## What I Learned
This was my first time using Android Studio and a third party API for an app. It was difficult at first, but I got a good experience completing this project.
