summary: I volunteered at the 2016 Kawaii Kon event for the Cosplay Cafe.

Kawaii Kon is an event that helps spread Japanese culture, specifically the otaku culture. It involves Japanese language, manga, anime, and other cultural things. For the event I was volunteering as a server for the Cosplay Cafe, a small cafe where you can sit down, play games, eat snacks, and drink milk. The event itself is three days long and I was serving for all three. The main reasons why I volunteered was: I loved otaku culture and I needed volunteer hours for my scholarship.
