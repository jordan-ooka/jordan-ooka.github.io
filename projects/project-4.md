## ICS 314 Project
In the 2017 Fall semester I took a class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It was called ICS 314 Software engineering. At the end of the semester I had to create a web application project with some of my classmates. After a few weeks we created our app called Community.

## What is Community?
Community is our app that we created so UH Manoa students can search for their clubs online using this app. The way that clubs are displayed at UH is on a giant Excel sheet which is not the best for the user to use. Our app allows students make a profile, view clubs, like clubs, edit clubs, and view other profiles to see who likes what clubs. 

## My contribution 
We created this application as a team so we all had different parts in the creation of it. The parts that I added were the collection for club and the club admin page.
