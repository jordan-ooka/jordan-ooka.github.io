## ICS 314 Project
In the 2017 Fall semester I took a class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It was called ICS 314 Software engineering. At the end of the semester I had to create a web application project with some of my classmates. After a few weeks we created our app called Community.

## What is Community?
Community is our app that we created so UH Manoa students can search for their clubs online using this app. The way that clubs are displayed at UH is on a giant Excel sheet which is not the best for the user to use. Our app allows students make a profile, view clubs, like clubs, edit clubs, and view other profiles to see who likes what clubs. 

## My contribution 
We created this application as a team so we all had different parts in the creation of it. The parts that I added were the collection for club and the club admin page.

## What I Learned
This project gave me some real experience working on a program in a group. There is a lot of communication involved and the smallest miscommunication can create conflicts within the code. There were many times where that happened because of our lack of communication. It is also a good idea to plan ahead before you start to code. We made some rough design but we did not think how we were going to do the actual programming and we ended up finding errors in our designs that could have been avoided if we spent more time reviewing the design.
