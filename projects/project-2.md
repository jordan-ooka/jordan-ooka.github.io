In 2012 I started playing a game called League of Legends. League of Legends is classified as a MOBA game: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. It is a team-based game that requires knowledge of game mechanics and other team working strategies. It is currently one of the most played and profiting games available. The game was released in 2009 and is still ongoing today. There are various types of gameplay, but the one most people play is the normal game mode. 

  For the normal game mode, there are 10 players. There are two teams, 5 players each team and each team chooses a character called a champion. Each champion is unique in its gameplay statistics and abilities. Some champions are better at certain roles in the game than other champions. The main roles are tanks, the defensive types in the game; supports the types with a lot of utility; Attack Damage Carries or adc, the high damaging types that use physical damage, normally ranged; mages, the high damaging types that use magic damage; junglers the types that fight non-player enemies to level and later support their teammates; and assassins, the melee version of the adc. Sometimes champions have aspects of more than one role. The goal of the game was to destroy the enemy team's main building called the nexus. There are many other game elements involved that can aid you in obtaining victory but that can be explained by visiting their website or simply searching for a youtube video about the game. 
    Since there are many factors involved in the gameplay, one must memorize all the different mechanics in the game. This includes, item statistics, champion statistics, champion abilities, objective statistics, positioning strategies and many more. As of August 2017, there are 138 champions availible to play and memorize. It takes time and practice to get really good at the game.
    
  In 2015 I was playing the League of Legends ranked system in which I obtained the rank of Platinum V, which now currently makes up for 3.31% of all the millions of players playing. My role in my team was mainly the support. I was in charge of predicting the enemy team's movements, scouting the enemy territory, disabling the enemy champions and protecting/assisting my teammates. It required a lot of communication in order to get the team coordinated and I had to know what each player's champion could do and what were the best actions that they should take in order to increase our chances at victory. Although the pressure may be big, I always had fun in playing the game.
