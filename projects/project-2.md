In 2015 I played competively in a game called League of Legends in which I obtained the rank of Platinum V which now currently makes up for 3.31% of all the millions of players playing. League of Legends is classified as a MOBA game: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena. It is a team-based game that requires knowledge of game mechanics and other team working strategies. It is currently one of the most played and profiting games available. I gained critical thinking and communication skills from this game.
