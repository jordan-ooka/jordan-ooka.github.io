## Coding Standards 
Coding standards are important in programming, especially when you are working with other programmers. I am sure that every educated programmer has had experience with coding standards either in the classroom, online, or in the workplace. Some of them like coding standards, others not so much. Some do not like conforming to standards and instead prefer to write code in their own personal style because they are more comfortable with it, while others actually prefer the coding standards and are willing to adjust. I believe that coding standards are essential in good programming. They are key in communication and they can help you learn how to code. 
### Communication
Coding standards are important in communication.

### Learning 
Coding standards are a great way to learn programming.
