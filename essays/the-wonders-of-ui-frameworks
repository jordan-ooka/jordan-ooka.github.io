## UI Frameworks
### UI frameworks are tools that we as programmers can use for user interface programming. They are used to make websites easily
and efficiently. I found some pros and cons with UI frameworks that I will point out below.

## Pros
### If you are using UI frameworks, you can do a lot of html and css coding with a reduced amount of written code. As a result
you can produce a stylish and attractive user interface within a small amount of time. The UI frameworks also makes the code
more simple to write. I had experience using one of these frameworks. The UI framework that I used was Semantic UI. 
From my experience, Semantic UI was a good tool to have. It didn't replace html and css, but it did reduce the amount I needed to
put. 

## Cons
### If you are using UI frameworks, you will need to know all the different key words and functions that that specific UI framework
offers. You would need to have an understanding of html, css, and the UI framework that you are using. You would need to study the 
different key words for the UI framework and their html equals.

## End Result
### I think that UI frameworks are nice assets to have. If you spend the time to learn about them, you will get great results. It may be 
confusing at first, but after it all becomes ingrained in your mind, you'll be a more efficient programmer.
