## Javascript 
 I like Javascript. When I first started my ICS 314 class I never really knew about how to program in Javascript. As I went through the tutorials and screencasts I realized that the language was easy to understand. For me, it was as if someone took Java and made it even more easier and user-friendly. The fact I can just type 'let' or 'const' instead of a variable type like 'int' or 'double' made things easy. I also liked how freely I can send these variables into functions. It really made me more relaxed when programming. 
On the flipside though. I question how well it can be when involving memory. In the C language, I had the power of pointers but as I can see so far with Javascript, I do not have it anymore. I need to study this language some more until I can fully determine my feelings about it. 

## WODS
 The WODs, or workout of the day, that I have experienced in my ICS 314 programming class have been helpful to me. It allows me to practice my coding skills and do it under pressure. I know that they will help me become a more efficient programmer, but since I have other classes and a part-time job, it can be stressful to do. As long as the WODs are easy to understand, I can make it through the stress.
