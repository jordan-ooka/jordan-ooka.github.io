I started play video games when I was four years old. It was my daily source of entertainment that kept me from eternal boredom. As I was growing up, my passion for gaming increased and before I knew it, gaming became an essential part of who I am. I always wondered why others struggled to remember history dates, yet I could remember the storyline of each game or the fighting mechanics of each enemy. I wondered why math could be hard to others when I could calculate the statistics from the equipment in my games within seconds. Video games helped me improve my thinking skills while also keeping me entertained. My abilities, knowledge, and way of thinking were all developed by my passion for video games. 

In high school I was asked what I wanted to do as a career. I did not believe I could get well paying job off just playing video games alone, so I was at a loss. It was then that I was told about computer science. I realized that instead of playing the video game, I could be the one creating the video game. A few years after high school and I am now a student majoring in Information and Computer Science. I may not be creating video games at the moment but to me, the art of programming is a game already.
