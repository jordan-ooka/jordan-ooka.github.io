## My First Experience With Meteor
My first experience with Meteor was fun. I worked on a project for my ICS 314 class using it. There were things that I disliked about Meteor, things that I thought were cool about Meteor, and things that I liked about Meteor. I think if you take the time to learn how to use Meteor efficiently, then you can gain a powerful tool in programming.
