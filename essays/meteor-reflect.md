## My First Experience With Meteor
My first experience with Meteor was fun. I worked on a project for my ICS 314 class using it. There were things that I disliked about Meteor and things that I liked about it. I think if you take the time to learn how to use Meteor efficiently, then you can gain a powerful tool in programming.

### My Likes
Meteor was interesting to use. I never used anything like it before. The things that realy stood out to me was how when the files were adjusted, the client and server updated automatically to the adjustment and would even crash if there were certain errors. It reminded me a lot about online video games and social media websites in how things are constantly changing. I also liked how effective it could be with programming once I learned how to use it properly. Another thing to note is that when you create errors, the location of the errors can be shown by Meteor. 

### My Dislikes
Sadly Meteor has its flaws like everything else. To start with, everytime I run Meteor is seems like my laptop loses 50% of its battery life within the first half hour so make sure you have a charger with you. Also unless you have a good programming computer, it will take ages for Meteor to run and for the files to be indexed to your IDE. It also takes a lot of space on your screen since you will be running Meteor, your IDE, MongoDB, and possibly a browser. I would recommned a huge screen or multiple screens. 

### Overall Thoughts
From what it sounds like, Meteor can be a demanding tool, but if you are willing to deal with the demands, it can be a useful addition to your programming ability. I don't know if or when I will be using Meteor again after my ICS 314 class but I am glad I got to have the experience with it.
