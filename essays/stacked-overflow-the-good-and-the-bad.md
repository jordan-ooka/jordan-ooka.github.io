## Types Of Questions 
A great thing about the internet is that it allows people all around the world to communicate in a quick and efficient way. All the questions that you have can be answered by someone or something online, although sometimes those answer may not be the ones that you want. Depending on how you ask a question, people may respond to it in a different way. Some people might not even bother reading a bad question, while others may give sarcastic feedback. There are a few generous people who take time out of their day to help people with bad questions despite the question's lack of quality, but you shouldn't be relying on them for assistance at all times. Simply put, the better constructed the question, the better constructed the answer. If you are expecting a intellectual answer, then ask an intellectual question. StackedOverflow is a great place to ask questions and receive answers about programming. I found two questions there, one good and one not so good. I did not include the authors of these questions in the case that people will seek them out. 

### The Good
This is a good question. It's on the topic of coding and it's simple and straight to the point. There's no unnecessary information and it gained a good amount of feedback.

I'm using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement.
Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===?
Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.
If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?

This question received lots of answers that included: code examples, references and the insight of others. This type of reaction to the question is very useful to the author of the question and for others who read it. This shows that a good question receives a good answer.


### The Bad
Here is the bad question. The author of the question first states that he is a newbie at coding and asks a question that can be easily answered by doing a google search. 

I am new to all of these languages and I am not quite sure why we need all of them together.
Is there a simple explanation of the role of each one? and how come there isn't a programming language
that encompasses all the functionalities of these 3?

The feedback received was completely different from the good question. I wouldn't say the question was the worst but it was definitely not a great question. The author's question recieved almost no answers and was even put on hold by other members because the question was off-topic. It would have been better if the author asked this question on a website more suited to this type of question. This shows that if your questions aren't suited for answering then many will not do so.

## End Result
In the end, there was a difference between the quality of the question and the quality of the answer. Good questions received good feedback, while bad questions receieved bad feedback. From now on whenever you need to ask a question online, remember what you learned today and don't be a newbie who asks bad questions, be the one to ask a good question.
